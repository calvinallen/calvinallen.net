## Who I am
![Me!](https://gravatar.com/avatar/a1c6325a95a54f6321b05edb40490f57?s=300)

I'm Calvin and I'm currently a work-from-home software developer with the Virginia-based company, [Heuristic Solutions](http://www.heuristics.net). Being a part of the [LearningBuilder](http://www.learningbuilder.com) (the leading credential management solution) team means I get the opportunity to work with .NET/MVC, C#, JavaScript, and other tools on a daily basis.

Creating and maintaining software is my passion, and I take a lot of pride in my work. I like to keep up to date on the latest developments in the industry, and try to play a role in the community as much as I can. And, since I do work 100% remote from home, I greatly enjoy any opportunity to get out and meet other developers in the Columbus, Ohio area.

Outside of the office, I'm likely spending time with my family. I'm married to the greatest woman ever (that just kicked cancers ass), and we have a young daughter named Ava. You can often find us watching 
[Elmo](http://www.sesamestreet.org/muppets/elmo), playing with bubbles, watching [Elmo](http://www.sesamestreet.org/parents/theshow/episodes/elmos-world), going on wagon rides, on watching [Elmo](https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=elmo).
