## Who I am
I'm a goal oriented software developer, focused on quality and commitment. I pursue clean code and simple designs. I consider continuous education a cornerstone of my career and life; getting better is the only option. I'm a quick learner, eager to contribute, and a passionate leader.

I can (& will) be an asset to any team I'm apart of - from analysis and design, to development and testing, all the way through to delivery.

This isn't just a career - it's a lifestyle.
