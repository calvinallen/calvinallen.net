## The New .NET World: Framework, Core, and Standard
The .NET world is changing, and fast. New frameworks and terminology are being tossed around, but do you know what they all mean? Do you know what .NET Standard means, and how it affects the .NET Framework? Do you need to be concerned with .NET Core?  Confusion between these items now may hurt your project in the future.

In this presentation, we're going to look at all of these questions and really get to the bottom of their purpose and meaning.  As you leave, you will have a better understanding of the current state of .NET, which will help you better understand the future.


## Building a Real-World, Functioning, Functional UI Testing Suite
Functional UI testing is hard.  Once you think you know what you need to do, you need to build the framework to do it.  You’ll soon realize that running it manually all the time is costing you money and time, and you need to automate it.

In this presentation, we’ll take a look at how you can create a suite of automated, functional UI tests for any web application.  We’ll be using sample projects (C# / .NET / Selenium) based on a real world web application that houses over 500 functional UI tests!
