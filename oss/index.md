#### [Open In Notepad++](https://github.com/CalvinAllen/OpenInNotepadPlusPlus) 
**.NET / C# - Visual Studio Extension**

A Visual Studio extension that adds a menu command that lets you open any solution, project, folder or file in Notepad++.

Based HEAVILY on [Mads Kristensen's OpenInSublimeText](https://github.com/madskristensen/OpenInSublimeText) extension.

This extension is for those times where you have a project open in Visual Studio and you want to be able to quickly open it in Notepad++.

#### [CouchbaseExplorer](https://github.com/CalvinAllen/couchbase-explorer) 
**.NET / C# - Visual Studio Extension**

Another extension for Visual Studio (currently incomplete), for communicating with a Couchbase Server, while staying in Visual Studio.  At some point, I'd like to finish this, but for now its on the back-burner.

#### [AchievR](https://github.com/CalvinAllen/achievr) 
**Elixir - Web Application**

My first attempt at an Elixir-based web application, using the idea of "OKR"s as the basis for creation (creating, managing, scoring, etc.).  This idea barely got started before it got put on the back-burner as well.
