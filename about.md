## Who I am
![Me!](https://gravatar.com/avatar/a1c6325a95a54f6321b05edb40490f57?s=300)

I'm Calvin and I'm C# / .NET technical architect in the Columbus, OH area. Creating and maintaining software is my passion, and I take a lot of pride in my work. I like to keep up to date on the latest developments in the industry, and try to play a role in the community as much as I can.

Outside of the office, I'm likely spending time with my family. I'm married to the greatest woman ever (that just kicked cancers ass), and we have a young daughter named Ava.
