I've been promoting the [GitKraken Git Client](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client) for a little while on social media, because it's such a beautiful, cross-platform, and just overall fantastic GUI Git client made by the folks over at [Axosoft](https://www.axosoft.com/).

Recently, I learned that [Axosoft](https://www.axosoft.com/) started a [GitKraken Ambassador](https://www.gitkraken.com/ambassador) program.  The idea being that you help promote the product, and they provide "swag" (shirts, stickers, etc.) to give away - plus, they give you (as an Ambassador) a free one year license for GitKraken (and, no, I didn't know about that part when applying :)).

Since I was already happily promoting the product, I applied, and earlier this evening learned that I was accepted!

What does this mean?  Well, I'll still be promoting the product, but I'll probably make it a little more obvious (referral links, using it on live streams and videos, working it into conference talks, etc.).  I'll also be spending some time checking out (and promoting) [GitKraken Glo Boards](https://www.gitkraken.com/glo)(a "Trello" competitor that integrates directly into the [GitKraken Git Client]((https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client))

If you'd like to try out [GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/git-client), maybe download it and give it a shot?
