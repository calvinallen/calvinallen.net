I finally decided to jump on the [dev.to](https://www.dev.to) bandwagon, and I don't say that lightly.  I generally despise third-party blogging platforms and that usually turns out to be a good decision (i.e., [Medium](https://www.medium.com)).

[Dev.to](https://www.dev.to) is different though, at least so far.  They seem very transparent about the platform they're building, where funding is coming from, etc.  The feature that roped me in, however, was being able to import my RSS feed from this site, and make each imported post reference the original post here, as the canonical url.

For me, it's about trying to get my posts in front of more people, because I don't actually mind "managing my own blog". For reference, when I say "managing my own blog", I'm using:

* [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (ruby-based static website generator)
* [GitHub](https://www.github.com) (hosting the code, and allowing it to be OSS - yes, you can submit a PR to one of my posts ðŸ˜Š)
* [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) (domain host).  

The best part?  It's all 100% free (besides buying/renewing the domain name).  And, to be completely honest, I enjoy this setup.  I can write a post in markdown and push the code to GitHub.  Once there, [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com) is "notified" of the code change, pulls the latest from [my GitHub repository](https://www.github.com/calvinallen/calvinallen.net), builds, and then deploys it.  Importing the posts to [my dev.to profile](https://www.dev.to/calvinallen) is automatic, I just have to manually "publish" them once there. 

All in all, it's a beautiful thing. 

Let me know if you're interested in setting something like this up on your own and need some help, I love blogging and believe we need to do more of it (myself included)!
