I realized earlier that today marks my one year anniversary at [Heuristic Solutions](http://www.heuristics.net) (thanks, Facebook ‘On this day’ :-) ).

My time at Heuristics has definitely been a game changer for me. Being able to work alongside [Seth Petry-Johnson](https://www.twitter.com/spetryjohnson) and [Matthew Groves](https://www.twitter.com/mgroves) has proved beneficial beyond my imagination. To say, “I’ve learned a lot”, would be an oversimplification of the amount of knowledge I’ve gained over the past year, but that’s the easiest way to put it – I truly have learned a lot.

What does the next year hold?

Hard to say for sure. I would imagine a ton of new lines of code for [LearningBuilder](http://www.learningbuilder.com) and more learnin’.

Outside of that, surprise me.
