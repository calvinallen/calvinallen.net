Over the last few weeks, I’ve been indulging in the content delivered to my inbox by a Mr. John Sonmez.

This content, or what is better known as his 5 day email course on blogging, has been a delight to consume. If you’ve never blogged before, but have always wanted to, I suggest you subscribe to John’s email course. He provides a clear and concise path for potential bloggers to get started easily and quickly that I haven’t found in other blogging materials.

For me, personally, since I’m already somewhat of a blogger, it’s provided a ton of ideas that I plan to work through and implement here.
