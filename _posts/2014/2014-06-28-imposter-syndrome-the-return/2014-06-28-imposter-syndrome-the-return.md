title: "Imposter Syndrome - The Return"

As most of you know, I recently started a new job with Heuristic Solutions working on their LearningBuilder product. I’ve been with them now for about a month, and up until about last week, things were going great. Then, out of nowhere, The Imposter Monster made its unwelcoming return.

Now, I’ve always been rather hard on myself when it comes to my work. Doubts plague me daily about where I am and where I should be. They never quite overlap in my mind – probably never will – but I’m working on it.

Having said all of that, I do believe that part of this is just from the stress of starting a new job. Everybody has been there, I imagine. You leave a job where you provided value, felt good about the decisions you made, knew everyone, etc. – then, all of a sudden, you’re back on the bottom of the totem pole without any of those happy feelings.

Am I supposed to be here? Do I deserve this job? Do I fit in? Do I actually have what it takes to bring value to this company?

I can’t answer those questions.

All I really wanted to do was get this post out here, in hopes that if someone is feeling the same way, perhaps they’ll come across this post and realize – they’re NOT alone.
