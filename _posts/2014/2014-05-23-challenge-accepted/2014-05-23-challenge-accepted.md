The last few weeks have been a little stressful here at the Allen household due to the job situation, but things are turning around!

On Tuesday, May 27th, I will be starting a new job that I'm extremely excited about.

What is it you ask?

Well, I have accepted an offer with [Heuristic Solutions](http://www.heuristics.net) to work on their [LearningBuilder](http://www.learningbuilder.com) product!

Not only do I get to work with a fantastic team of people on a great product, but I get to do it from home!
