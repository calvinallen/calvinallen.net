title: "Three 'Must Have' Visual Studio Extensions"
tags: [extensions, visualstudio]
---

Every single time I install Visual Studio, the very next step I take is to install my favorite extensions. I only have three, and here they are, in order:

* [ReSharper](http://www.jetbrains.com/resharper/) - I can't live without this anymore. I'm finally to the point where I have a lot of shortcuts memorized. VS is catching up, but R# still takes the win.
* [NCrunch](http://www.ncrunch.net/) - Continuous testing, right in VS. Love my green dots.
* [WallabyJs](https://wallabyjs.com/) - Continuous JAVASCRIPT testing, right in VS. Love my green squares :D

Pretty simple list, eh?

What about you? What are your favorite extensions? Is there something groundbreaking that I'm missing out on? Something you developed yourself? Leave it in the comments!

*Also, props to WallabyJs for being the only one in my list WITH HTTPS, BY DEFAULT.
