Recently, I've become somewhat hooked on watching a few people live code various things on Twitch.  

Here's the list of people I've currently been tuning into, as the schedule allows:

### Kyle Shevlin
Kyle streams mostly JavaScript related programming

### Suz Hinton
Suz streams a variety of items, from merging pull requests, to speed coding, to IoT

### Jeff Blankenburg
Jeff has just recently started streaming on Alexa development, and I hope he does more of it!

### Jeff Fritz
Jeff has been doing a stellar job of streaming on a consistent schedule, on a variety of topics, and has
even starting bringing on guests for pair coding!

These are the only 4 coding-related streamers I've come across so far, but I'm definitely looking for more.

Do you have anyone you recommend?  Let me know in the comments!
