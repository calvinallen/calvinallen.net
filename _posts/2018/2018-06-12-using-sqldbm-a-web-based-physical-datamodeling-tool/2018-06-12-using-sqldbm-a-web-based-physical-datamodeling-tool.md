I recently stumbled upon a new tool for modeling database structures - [sqlDBM](https://sqldbm.com), and I had to share it because its awesome.

I generally always take a "database up" design approach to software development.  For me, designing the physical data model *really*
solidifies the forthcoming code.

In the past, I've used Toad (or whatever its called), and PowerDesigner (from SAP).  Toad never really stuck for me, and PowerDesigner is crazy expensive.  I don't
mind paying a few bucks a month for services, or a flat fee for a product - but PowerDesigner is in the thousands.  Ain't nobody got time for that.

With a little searching, the product came right to the top.  I hadn't seen it before (it's still in Beta, so pretty new), but being web-based, it immediately caught
my attention.

I signed up, validated my email address, and off I went.  It was that easy.

Now, since sqlDBM is still in beta, I'm not currently paying anything for it - although they currently do have a "donate" option that I will likely use shortly.

I won't go into the details of "physical database design", but within the scope of what I've used - I'm impressed.  I was able to quickly create a model, start adding 
tables, columns, and constraints - issue a save, and then share it out to other people with an invitation into the application.  And, honestly, it *looks good*, too - even had a "dark" theme (which I totally love).  Some of the other features mentioned on the website (that I haven't yet personally used):

* Revisions - Every time you save, a new revision is created - allowing you to rollback to a previous version is you mess up :)
* MySQL Support - I'm using SQL Server, this is another option
* Subject Areas - Create diagrams in separate "areas" to limit the viewing scope of the model

The level of physical data modeling I do anymore is minimal, but I'll be keeping sqlDBM in my back pocket anytime the need comes up.
