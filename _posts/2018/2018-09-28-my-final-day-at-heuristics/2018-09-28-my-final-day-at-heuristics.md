Today is bittersweet.

Today was my final day at Heuristics, and I had to bid adieu to my teammates of the last 4.33 years.  We did a lot of cool things together, and I'm proud of everything we shipped (well, most of it anyway).  I can honestly say that I learned a *ton* about begin a better software developer, about being on a remote team, shipping a quality application, and a lot more.

So, what's next?

Well, I've accepted a position as a Senior Developer at JPMorgan Chase here in town, where I'll get to put my skills to use on a .NET Core application, which I'm very excited about!  

I don't start until October 8th, so until then, I'll be getting my home office rearranged into a "production studio" to support my [Twitch channel](https://luv2.dev/live) / [YouTube channel](https://luv2.dev/archives) (CodeBytesTV) and [upcoming podcast](https://www.dotnetbytes.fm/) (.NET Bytes).
